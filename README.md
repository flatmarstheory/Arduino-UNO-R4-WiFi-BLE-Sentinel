# Arduino-UNO-R4-WiFi-BLE-Sentinel
BLE Clickjacking Detection Mechanism: A specialized cybersecurity awareness tool that transforms an Arduino UNO R4 WiFi into a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) monitor. It identifies nearby "input-injection" risks—such as rogue keyboards, mice, or remotes—and provides real-time proximity alerts via a physical LED and a mobile-friendly web dashboard.
